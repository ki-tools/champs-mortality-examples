# champs-mortality examples

This repository stores some examples of web reports created using the [champs-mortality](https://github.com/ki-tools/champs-mortality) R package.

Note that the package is still under active development and a lot of validation needs to occur before the reported statistics can be trusted.

Also note that the web reports are still under active development and will eventually contain a more information about the methodology and all the necessary footnotes where special computations are made.

The examples below create the reports in this repository.

The outputs of these can be viewed here:
